## Description

There are N rooms and you start in room 0. Each room has a distinct number in `0, 1, 2, ..., N-1`, and each room may have some keys to access the next room. 

Formally, each room *i* has a list of keys `rooms[i]`, and each key `rooms[i][j]` is an integer in `[0, 1, ..., N-1]` where `N = rooms.length`. A key `rooms[i][j] = v` opens the room with number *v*.

Initially, all the rooms start locked (except for room 0). You can walk back and forth between rooms freely.

Return `true` if and only if you can enter every room.
