## Description

Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

## Example

```python

# Example 1
intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]  # Input
[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]                    # Output
# Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].

# Example 2
intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]  # Input
[[1,5]]                    # Output
# Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

```

## Solution

```python
def merge(intervals):
    new_intervals = []
    # INSERT CODE HERE
    return new_intervals
```
