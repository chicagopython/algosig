## Description

Process a list of integers in chunks. The first integer of each chunk will be `1`, `2` or `99`. If `1`, the next two integers refer to the *list position* of two other integers that should be *added*. If the first integer is `2`, the same applies, but *multiplication* should be used. The fourth integer refers to the position in the list where the result should be placed. If the first integer is `99`, the process is complete and should terminate.

What is the final value of the list element at position 0?

For example:
1. Given input:
    ```
    [1,9,10,3,2,3,11,0,99,30,40,50]
    ```
2. Add 30 and 40 and assign to position 3:
    ```
    [1,9,10,70,2,3,11,0,99,30,40,50]
    ```
3. Multiply 70 and 50 and assign to position 0:
    ```
    [3500,9,10,70,2,3,11,0,99,30,40,50]
    ```
4. Hit 99 and terminate


## Solution

```python
# Part 1
ls = open('input.txt').read().strip()
ls = [int(i) for i in ls.split(',')]

def solve(ls, noun=12, verb=2):
    ls[1] = noun
    ls[2] = verb

    i = 0

    while i < len(ls) - 4 and ls[i] != 99:
        assert ls[i] in {1, 2, 99}

        a = ls[ls[i + 1]]
        b = ls[ls[i + 2]]

        if ls[i] == 1:
            ls[ls[i + 3]] = a + b
        elif ls[i] == 2:
            ls[ls[i + 3]] = a * b

        i += 4

    return ls[0]

print(solve(ls.copy()))

# Part 2
for noun in range(100):
    for verb in range(100):
        if solve(ls.copy(), noun, verb) == 19690720:
            print(noun, verb, 100 * noun + verb)
```
