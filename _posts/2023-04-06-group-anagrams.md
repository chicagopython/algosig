## Description

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Example

```python

strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"] # Input
[["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]  # Output

```

## Solution

```python
    # INSERT CODE HERE
```
