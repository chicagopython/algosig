## Description

Implement a trie (prefix tree) with `insert`, `search`, and `startsWith` methods. Tries are used in many applications such as spell checking, autocompletion, and ip routing.

`insert(word)` Inserts the string word into the trie.

`search(word)` Returns `True` if the string word is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and `False` otherwise.

`startsWith(prefix)` Returns `True` if there is a previously inserted string word that has the prefix `prefix`, and `False` otherwise.

*Part 2* of this problem (not shown on LeetCode) is to implement an `autoComplete` method.
