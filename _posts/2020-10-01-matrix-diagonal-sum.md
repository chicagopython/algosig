## Problem

Given a square matrix `mat`, return the sum of the matrix diagonals.

```python
# Example Input
mat = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]

# Example Output
25

# Explanation (note that 5 is not repeated)
1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 7 == 25
```

## Solution

```python
def diagonal_sum(mat):

  return
```
