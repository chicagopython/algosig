## Description

Given an integer list `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, `[3,6,2,7]` is a subsequence of the array `[0,3,1,6,2,2,7]`.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
```


## Solution

```python
def lengthOfLIS(nums):
  # Insert code here
  
 ```
