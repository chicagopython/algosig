## Description

Given an integer array `nums`, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.

Example 1:
```python
# Input
nums = [2,3,-2,4]
# Output
6
# Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
```

Example 2:
```python
# Input
nums = [-2,0,-1]
# Output
0
# Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
```


## Solution ##

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
      # Insert code here
  

  ```
