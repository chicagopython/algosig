This site is designed for [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). *No local setup is required*.
1. Fork the repository
2. Create or edit a [markdown file](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) in the `_posts` folder. See existing posts for header variables to include.
3. Submit a pull request. Upon approval, your changes will be added the hosted website.

## Local Development

In order to make changes to the website design or archictecture and preview the website on a local server, you will need a local development environment. Follow these steps.

### Install Jekyll and Ruby

Follow the [appropriate guide for your system](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). Specific notes for Windows are provided here.

#### Windows 10 with WSL

1. [Install WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store
2. Follow the [WSL Jekyll installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/#installation-via-bash-on-windows-10)
    * If you receive a permission error at `gem update` or `gem install jekyll bundler`, read [Running Jekyll as Non-Superuser (no sudo!)](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#no-sudo)
    * Modify your `.bashrc` in your Ubuntu user directory:
        ```bash
        nano ~/.bashrc
        ```
    * Add the following lines :
        ```
        # Ruby exports

        export GEM_HOME=$HOME/gems
        export PATH=$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH
        ```

        Restart the terminal, or reload `.bashrc`:
        ```bash
        . ~/.bashrc
        ```
    * Resume the [WSL Jekyll installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/#installation-via-bash-on-windows-10).
